            Welcome to Tic Tac Toe! 🎮
            You will be playing against the AI. You are 'X' and the AI is 'O'.
            The board positions are numbered 0 to 8 as follows:

            ```
            0 | 1 | 2
            ---------
            3 | 4 | 5
            ---------
            6 | 7 | 8
            ``` 

      - step_id: "step_1"
        title: "Your Move"
        question: "Enter a position number (0-8) to place your 'X'. Say restart or exit to quit."
        tokens_for_ai: |
          Using the metadata, determine if the game is over and 'restart'.
          If the user wants to restart or play again, categorize as 'restart'
          If ai_wins or user_wins or is_draw is true, categorize as 'restart'.
          If the user wants to exit, categorize as 'exit'.
          If the game_over is True categorize as 'restart'.
          Finally check:
          If the move is valid, categorize as 'valid_move'.
          If the move is invalid, categorize as 'invalid_move'.
        feedback_tokens_for_ai: |
          Always speak in first person. DO NOT START WITH "ai_move:".
          Player is always X, You the AI are always O.
          If there is an error in the metadata the move was likely invalid.
          On a new line, provide feedback on the user's move.
          Only announce a winner or tie if game_over is True.
          The player makes the first and last move.
          If the move is invalid, prompt the user to try again.
          If the move is invalid, give a list of valid moves.
          If the move is valid & no errors say your move on the last line (ai_move) for example: I move to 8 and draw a O".
